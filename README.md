#Project Summary :
In this project, we aimed to create a minor LIM-GROUP, ARR-DYN type swarm robots to perform a goal searching procedure. The objective is to implement the Alpha-Beta coordination algorithm for effective goal searching. All the agents are to be monitored by the end-user through a computer (Home Board). The performance of the swarm was tested in various scenarios and the results were analysed. The importance of this algorithm can be realised as a basis for many complex dynamic task allocation algorithms. 

#Code Description :
These are the Arduino .ino files for each swarm robot labelled 'A', 'B' and 'C'. The code implements the Apha-Beta algorithm for 3 mini autonomous swarm robots to find and locate the RF beacon situated within the arena and converge to it.
